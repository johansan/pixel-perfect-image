## How to Use

1. Install the plugin from Obsidian's Community Plugins
2. Right-click an image in your notes
3. Available options:
   - View filename and dimensions
   - Resize to preset percentages
   - Copy, open, or show in system
   - Open in external editor
   - Rename image files
4. Quick resize with mousewheel:
   - Hold Alt key (Option on macOS) and scroll over an image
   - Scroll up to increase size, down to decrease
   - Modifier key can be changed in settings (Alt/Ctrl/Shift)
   - Zoom percentage can be adjusted in settings (default 20%)
   - Each scroll step changes size by the configured percentage of current width
5. Quick actions:
   - CMD/CTRL + click: Open image in new tab

The plugin calculates the new width based on the original image dimensions.

## Examples

Original wikilink:
```md
![[image.png]]
```

After resizing to 50%:
```md
![[image.png|500]]
```
(assuming the original image was 1000px wide)

Using custom resize width:
```md
![[image.png|600]]
```
(setting exact width to 600 pixels)

You can configure multiple custom widths (e.g., 600, 800, 1200) in settings, which will appear as separate menu options.

## Known Issues

### Windows and Minimal Theme

When using Pixel Perfect Image on Windows PCs with the Minimal theme, the built-in image zoom can interfere with the right-click menu. To resolve this:

1. Install the Style Settings plugin
2. Go to Style Settings > Minimal > Images
3. Enable the "Disable image zoom" option

This will ensure the best experience with Pixel Perfect Image's right click menu.

### Image Converter Plugin Compatibility

If you're using the [Image Converter plugin](https://github.com/xryul/obsidian-image-converter), you should disable its "Right-click menu" option in settings to prevent conflicts with Pixel Perfect Image's context menu.
