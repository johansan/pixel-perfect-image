## How to Use

1. Install the plugin from Obsidian's Community Plugins
2. Right-click any image in your notes
3. You'll see:
   - The actual dimensions of the image in pixels
   - Options to resize the image to common percentages

The plugin will automatically calculate the new width based on the original image dimensions, ensuring pixel-perfect scaling.

## Examples

Original wikilink:
```md
![[image.png]]
```

After resizing to 50%:
```md
![[image.png|500]]
```
(assuming the original image was 1000px wide)

2. Navigate to Community Plugins
3. Search for "Pixel Perfect Image"
4. Click Install
